8/10 points :tada:
### Subtask 3 - README file formatting in GitHub - why did you decide to participate in challenge_portfolio?
Hi, my name is Paulina and in 2023 I have decided to change a lot of things in my life - one of those things is work. Although I am a ~~hysterian~~ historian, testing interested me enough to take on this challenge. At this stage I am a complete rookie, but there is a lot of willingness in me to learn and grow. I would like to become a responsible and prepared junior tester in the coming year, so that I can then get better and better at pointing out mistakes to others (joking!). I believe the DareIT challenge will enable me to do this. :blush:
### Subtask 4 - exploratory tests - explore the application
**1. What is this application about and what is it used for?**
* the application is a kind of database on individual players - their names, age, position, club, as well as reports of matches played
* is designed to help so-called 'talent hunters' find desirable players from the entire database
* also allows the creation of new player profiles and match and report panels

**2. What functionalities are included in the application? What are they used for. Are they intuitive, or would you change something?**
* possibility to log in and out
* password reset
* creating and editing a player panel
* use of the players' browser
* adding matches and reports
* convert data to csv file and print statements
* language conversion from Polish to English and vice versa

Due to the simple, even crude design of the site, the functionalities are relatively intuitive, but due to the existing bugs, you have to take the trouble in some cases (such as creating a report). I would change the very system of creating a player's profile - the form limits us in the selection to setting the origin from a specific province, while at the same time giving the possibility to enter the language the footballer speaks and translate the page into English. In a way, this suggests an international potential environment. In view of this, it would be worthwhile to expand the page with more origin options, such as country. In addition, I would simplify some of the functionalities, such as the possibility to select given answers from a drop-down list (such as the languages already mentioned).

**3. Evaluate the application interface (appearance).**

As I mentioned, the app's interface is very basic. On the main panel, apart from a single image symbolising the platform (which, in my opinion, is in a bad, unintuitive place on the page) and a few icons symbolising, for example, a change of language or a logout button, it is in vain to look for other "embellishments". The site is relatively easy to read, but it cannot be called minimalist - rather, it is very poor. What is missing here is the work of a designer who takes the visual aspect into account in addition to the practical expectations of the user.

**4. Is the application intuitive?**

At first glance, the app seems intuitive and easy to use (this also has to do with the visual aspect). However, the more over-the-top actions we want to perform, the app loses clarity.
* Browser - the magnifying glass is not an active element, which can confuse the user, only the enter validates the entered search phrase. It would also be convenient to have pop-up prompts already when entering the search term
* Sorting of data - no clear option to sort ascending/descending, only when clicking on headings does this functionality appear
* No possibility to export data into a format other than csv
* The "add" functionality for "matches and reports" is in a different location than for "players"

**5. Do you notice any mistakes? Or does something seem wrong to you?**
* it is possible to create a player with a negative height and weight (interestingly, the system tells us in which measurement system to enter the height, but does not specify this with the weight)
* it is possible to create a player whose date of birth is today/from the future
* phone number does not require entering numbers
* when completing a player's data, using the 'clear' button does not clear the data, but only undoes the last action performed
* The form does not tell us what data is incorrectly filled in (apart from highlighting the need to fill in compulsory data with an asterisk). Thus, when I entered the wrong email format (no @), the page did not prompt me, but only gave me the message that I could not create a player
* a match date from the future can be entered
* it is not possible to add a report via the main button - when you click on the "add report" button, you are redirected to the match panel
* non-standard playing time, non-standard number of game parts can be set
* typos

I have joined the team

# TASK 2 - test cases
### Subtask 1 - writing test cases based on the User Story

### Subtask 3 - why do we write test cases?
![alt text](https://testerzy.pl/assets/img/articles/old/jest-jedna-odpowiedz.jpg)

And seriously... :mag_right: Creating test cases is, in my opinion, one of the most essential tasks of a software tester. Coming up with different test cases not only strengthens our tester's inquisitiveness and creativity in coming up with problems, but above all ensures that we have not missed any functionality in the course of our work. A collection of such test cases will later also become the basis for our test reports. Test cases say a lot about the website/application being tested, so they are also invaluable help for new team members working on a given project who want to get acquainted with it. 

### Subtask 4 - writing test cases based on own experiences (PickEatUp mobile application)

### Subtask 3 - what is this application for?
**1. What is this application for? What is the purpose of this application?**

This application is primarily used to list various products or services for sale/gift/exchange. Users of the platform can use it by being the 'sender' or 'receiver' of an auction item. The purpose of the app is also to make money, both for the users who have successfully completed their auction with a sale; for the users who have gained an item/service by doing so, but also for the creators of the app, thanks to the profit from the sales commission.

**2. Who is to be the end user of the application?**

The end user of the application is a person who is looking for a good platform offering to broker different types of transactions. It can therefore be a cross-section of users: a chemistry student offering to tutor, a young couple wanting to get rid of an unwanted wardrobe, or a teenager who wants to increase his or her pocket money by selling an old jacket. For all these groups, however, the intuitiveness, simplicity and convenience of the application will be important.

**3. In your opinion, is this application user friendly?**

The OLX application is user friendly. The user-friendliness of the interface is due, among other things, to the clear panel containing the most important functionalities, located at the bottom of the screen (within reach of the thumb). Thanks to this, it does not take long to recognise the structure of the application. The search engine is also easily accessible and is located in the expected location (top of the screen). The application is able to generate push notifications, so that the user is able to find out about an action that has occurred even without entering the application. OLX also takes care of the user's security and payment by offering the possibility to use popular payment methods such as Blik. However, the application also has shortcomings, such as the lack of offline capability (at least of selected functionalities), or the lack of clear support for people with disabilities (e.g. visual or auditory) in using it.

**4. How would you improve the application? What would you improve about it? Do you have any ideas for additional functionality?**

The app, although refined, is not without its flaws. I feel that the system for quickly adding a particular offer (without entering it) to favourites is imperfect. The heart button that is used for this is so small that many times I mistakenly clicked minimally next to the button, which resulted in entering the offer. I would also add a counter for watched offers to the app, as once the pool of 150 offers is reached, the app blocks the ability to add more. Adding a counter would help the user keep track of this number. As I mentioned in the previous point, I would also develop more support for people with disabilities in the app so that they could also use it freely.

**5. What differences do you see between testing a web application and a native application?**

I was under the impression that the native app is more likely to trigger a direct interaction with the device we are using. It might send us directly to the device's settings or ask us for permission to use its resources (e.g. photos). By testing a native application, we have a greater opportunity to examine its impact and performance, as well as its compatibility with the device in question (software version, screen resolution). In the statistics, we can see its resource consumption, both memory and battery. When testing a web application, we are forced to use an 'intermediary', whose role is played by the browser. This robs the testing process of the aforementioned processes and makes it considerably shallower.
